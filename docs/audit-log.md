## 2026-06-10 Initial Open Gateway Track

- Created `/srv/aialra/apps/open-codex-app-web-gateway` from tracked files in

  secret files.
- Added local Responses-to-Chat bridge:
  - `/v1/responses`
  - `/v1/chat/completions` passthrough
  - `/v1/models`
  - `/healthz`
- Added local file store for `previous_response_id` replay.
- Added unit and mock-upstream tests.
- Added secret scan script and CI workflow.
